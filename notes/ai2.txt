personalities

base script 70/30 offense/defense and balanced AI, yet overall 50/50 
 then make personalities based off this base script


base script
  - expert level micro (line bombing with bombers)
  - flash peewee weasel bomber
    water map -> skeeter
  - economy building
  - aggressive scouting and radar building
  - non-cheating los/etc
  - have it check the built in (E/M) multiplier values (by difficulty) to prevent cheating
  - not too aggressive with the commander, make it a builder
  - if winning is improbable for the AI, attempt to draw (commander bombing)
  - 


unit memory ( for attacking )
 - calculations as a base for script-sided actions
