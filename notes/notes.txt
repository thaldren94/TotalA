we chose to not use lua, or any other language due to the following reasons:
 - bloat (library size compared to what is actually needed)
 - security (needing to remove other modules to prevent general system access)
 - modularity (ease of ability to adapt this implementation to other games)

if not careful, one can mistakenly have left remains of language implementations which were not intended for this purpose
plus bugs can be introduced where unintended behavior may arise without proper testing and knowledge of such language implementations
